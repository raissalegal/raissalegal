### Hi, glad you stopped by! :)

I'm Raíssa, an undergraduate student in Statistics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, south of Brazil. Here's a quick update on my college journey:

- 🧬 I’m currently diving into a new project about epidemiological trees and machine learning (that's pretty much why I'm on GitHub right now)
- 🗓 I’m in the 5th semester of the program
- 📚 Eyeing a major in Statistics or Computer Science after graduation
- 🧩 Besides college, I hit the gym and love tackling jigsaw puzzles (the 500+ piece ones 🤩)
- 🪐 I'm pretty much a naturalist and I'm into watching science channels
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm using ChatGPT to correct my English on this README, lol (not my mother tongue) -> ✨cheers to AI!✨
