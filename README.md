### Hi! :)

I'm Raíssa, an undergraduate student in Statistics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, south of Brazil. Here's a quick update on my college journey:

- 🗓 I’m in the 7th semester of the program
- 📊 I currently work at the Statistics Department in my university, building dashboards and presenting descriptive statistics on demand
- 📚 Eyeing a major in Statistics or Data Science after graduation
- 🧩 Besides college, I hit the gym and love tackling jigsaw puzzles (the 500+ piece ones 🤩)
- 🪐 I'm into watching science channels
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm using ChatGPT to correct my English on this README, lol (not my mother tongue) -> ✨cheers to AI!✨
